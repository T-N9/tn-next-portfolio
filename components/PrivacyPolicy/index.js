              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
                Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to
                signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
                online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
                technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
                has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
                browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
